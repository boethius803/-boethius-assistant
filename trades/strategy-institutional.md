# Institutional Price Action Trading Strategy (IPA)

## System Name: IPA (Institutional Price Action)

## Philosophy
Market institutions leave footprints in price action. We read those footprints, wait for confirmation, and trade alongside smart money — never against it.

---

## Market Structure

### Bullish Structure (Uptrend)
- Higher Highs (HH) and Higher Lows (HL)
- Each pullback holds above previous swing low
- Only look for LONG entries

### Bearish Structure (Downtrend)
- Lower Highs (LH) and Lower Lows (LL)
- Each rally fails below previous swing high
- Only look for SHORT entries

### Structure Shift (Break of Structure)
Most important moment — signals potential reversal.
- Bullish to bearish shift = potential SHORT
- Bearish to bullish shift = potential LONG

---

## Key Concept — Quasimodo Level (QML)

The QML is the level left behind after a structure shift:
- **Bullish shift:** Last Higher Low before the break → high-probability LONG entry
- **Bearish shift:** Last Lower High before the break → high-probability SHORT entry

---

## Core Patterns

### 1. Quasimodo (QM) Patterns
The backbone of the entire system. A QM forms when price makes a structural shift, leaving behind a key level (QML) for re-entry.

### 2. Liquidity Sweeps
Institutions need liquidity to fill large orders. They engineer moves to sweep stop losses (stop hunts) above resistance or below support before reversing. Enter when liquidity has been taken.

### 3. Supply/Demand Zones
Identify institutional order blocks where price has reversed before. Wait for re-entry at these zones.

### 4. Fakeouts
False breaks of structure that trap retail. Enter on confirmation of the true move.

## Entry Models

1. **QM Re-entry:** Wait for price to retest QML, confirm structure holds
2. **Liquidity Sweep Entry:** After stop hunt, enter on reversal candle
3. **Supply/Demand Flip:** Enter when zone is breached and flips
4. **Structure Break Confirmation:** Enter after confirmed break of structure

---

## Risk Management

- **Stop Loss:** Below/above recent swing (validate with liquidity)
- **Risk per trade:** Max 2% account
- **Position Size:** Calculate based on stop distance
- **Never risk more than you can lose**

---

## Golden Rule

> No trade without a Quasimodo, fakeout confirmation, or a clear supply/demand flip. If the setup doesn't match a pattern from this system, it's not your trade.

## Execution Checklist

- [ ] Identify market structure (HH/HL or LH/LL)
- [ ] Confirm trend direction
- [ ] Locate QML or key liquidity level
- [ ] Wait for retest/confirmation
- [ ] Enter with proper stop loss
- [ ] Define TP zones (previous swing high/low)

## Patience Over Frequency

This is a sniper system, not a scalper's machine gun. Wait for the full pattern to form, confirm the shift in structure, and execute with precision.

A handful of high-conviction trades per week outperforms 50 mediocre ones.
