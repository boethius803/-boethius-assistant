## 🎯 Philosophy

**Trade with the smart money, not against them.**

1. **Trade With Structure** — Never fight HH/HL or LH/LL
2. **Liquidity Is the Engine** — Institutions hunt stops before reversing
3. **Patience Over Frequency** — Sniper system, not a machine gun
4. **Confluence Stacking** — 2+ signals minimum before entry

> **Golden Rule:** No trade without a QM, fakeout confirmation, or clear S/D flip.

## 📊 Market Structure

### Trend Identification

| Term | Meaning | Signal |
|------|---------|--------|
| HH | Higher High | Uptrend confirmed |
| HL | Higher Low | Uptrend intact |
| LH | Lower High | Downtrend confirmed |
| LL | Lower Low | Downtrend intact |

### Structure Shift (BoS)
A shift from bullish→bearish (or vice) signals potential reversal. The level left behind = **QML (Quasimodo Level)**.

---

## 🔷 Key Concepts

### Supply & Demand Zones
- **Demand Zone (Green)** = Buying area, institutional accumulation
- **Supply Zone (Red)** = Selling area, institutional distribution
- Wait for price to return to zone + confirmation

### Zone Lifecycle
- **Fresh zone:** untouched, highest probability
- **Tested once:** still valid, moderate
- **Tested twice:** weakened, tread carefully
- **Tested 3x:** likely to break — avoid

### Liquidity (LQ)
- Equal highs/lows = liquidity magnets (stop clusters)
- Round numbers = institutional order clusters
- **Liquidity grab = opportunity** (retail stops taken = reversal)

## 📐 Pattern Library

### 1. QM (Quasimodo) Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Direction |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| QM Quick Retest | Fast retest after structure shift | Both |
| QM Late Retest | Slower return to QML | Both |
| QM Shadow | Wick tests QML (stronger signal) | Both |
| QM Re-Entry | Use "small QML" if missed main | Both |
| Continuation QM | QM in direction of trend | Both |
| Ignored QM (IQM) | Price blasts through QML = flip bias | Both |

### 2. Fakeout Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Fakeout V1 | Break & reverse quickly |
| Fakeout V2 (SR Flip) | Level flips to support/resistance |
| Fakeout V3 (Diamond) | Fakes both directions |
| Fakeout V3 + SBR | Diamond + level flip (highest conf.) |
| 2B/2S | Double top/bottom then fakeout |

### 3. Liquidity & Stop Hunt

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Stop Hunt Supply | Spike above highs, hunt buy stops, reverse |
| Stop Hunt Demand | Spike below lows, hunt sell stops, reverse |
| Compression (CF) | Tightening range, clear both sides |
| CPLQ | Compression + liquidity grab = breakout |

### 4. Flag & Continuation

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Flag B | Impulse + flag correction |
| Flag A + B | Two flags = stronger conviction |
| MPL (V-Twin) | V-shape + measured level |

### 5. Additional Structures

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Double SSR | Multiple tests before flip |
| 3 Drive | 3 pushes, 3rd = exhaustion |
| Can-Can | Cancel breakout, then cancel cancel |
| Can-Can + Fakeout | Highest confluence version |
| HH/R (Ruler) | Measured swings, project next move |

---

## 🎯 Entry Models

| Entry Model | Trigger | Stop Loss | Target | Min R:R |
|-------------|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| QML Touch | Limit at QML | Beyond swing | Opposite QML | 1:3 |
| QML + Engulfing | Engulfing at QML | Beyond wick | Next HH/LL | 1:3 |
| Fakeout Reversal | Close inside range | Beyond fakeout | Opposite + ext. | 1:2 |
| SR/RS Flip | Retest flipped level | Beyond zone | Next S/D | 1:2.5 |
| Stop Hunt Entry | Engulf after sweep | Beyond spike | Prev structure | 1:3 |
| Compression Break | Strong candle out | Middle of range | = range size | 1:2 |
| 3 Drive Reversal | Rejection on 3rd | Beyond extreme | Origin of 1st | 1:3 |
| Flag Limit | Engulf + QM confirm | Beyond flag | Measured move | 1:2.5 |

## 🛡️ Risk Management

### Position Sizing
- **Max risk per trade:** 1-2% of account
- **Max open risk:** 5%
- **Max correlated positions:** 2

### Risk-to-Reward
- **Minimum R:R:** 1:2
- **A+ setups:** 1:3 to 1:5

### Trade Management

| Phase | Action | Condition |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Entry | Place SL immediately | As defined |
| +1R | Move to BE, take 30-50% | 1× risk in profit |
| +2R | Take 25% more, trail to +1R | 2× risk |
| +3R | Close or trail tight | At target |
| Invalidation | Close immediately | Structure shift |

### ⚠️ Daily Loss Limit
**If you lose 3% in a day, STOP TRADING.**

## 🗓️ Execution Plan

### Pre-Market (30 min)
1. Mark HTF structure (Daily/4H)
2. Identify QMLs, S/D zones
3. Map liquidity pools
4. Set alerts at key levels
5. Define max 3 trade scenarios

### During Session
1. Wait for alerts → analyze LTF
2. Confirm pattern at key level
3. Check confluence (2+ signals)
4. Calculate position size
5. Execute — no improvisation

### Post-Session
1. Screenshot every trade
2. Log: pattern, entry model, R:R
3. Grade: A (perfect), B (decent), C (mistake)
4. Weekly: win rate per pattern
5. Monthly: which patterns perform best

### Timeframe Combinations

| Style | HTF (Bias) | MTF (Pattern) | LTF (Entry) | Hold |
|-------|------------|---------------|-------------|------|
| Swing | Weekly/Daily | 4H | 1H | Days-weeks |
| Intraday | Daily/4H | 1H/30m | 15m/5m | Hours |
| Scalp | 4H/1H | 15m | 5m/1m | Minutes |

## 🔄 Decision Tree

```
1. HTF BIAS → Is structure bullish or bearish on 4H/Daily?
2. KEY LEVELS → Mark QMLs, S/D zones, liquidity pools
3. PATTERN MATCH → Does price form a recognized pattern?
4. CONFLUENCE → Are 2+ signals aligned?
5. EXECUTE → Entry, stop, target — all pre-defined
```
