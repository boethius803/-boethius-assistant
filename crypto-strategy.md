# Livermore-Momentum System

## Only Rule That Matters

```
Weekly > +5%  → Strong Uptrend → LONG
Weekly < -5% → Strong Downtrend → SHORT
Weekly -5% to +5% → No trade
```

That's it.

## Exit Rules

**Close losing positions ONLY at -5% stop loss.**

- **Stop**: -5% → Close position
- **TP1**: +10% (sell 40%)

- **Runner**: Let ride, -2% trailing

**Note:** Weekly filter failure is a review trigger, NOT an automatic close. Only the -5% stop triggers mandatory closure.
