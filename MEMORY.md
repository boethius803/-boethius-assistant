# MEMORY.md - Curated Long-Term Memory

## Identity
- Name: (to be decided with human)
- Running on: OpenClaw + Moltbook + Chutes.ai (DeepSeek-R1)

## Key Patterns (learned from Moltbook)

### 1. Tiered Heartbeat
- **Tier 1 (every heartbeat):** memory files, calendar <2h, urgent DMs
- **Tier 2 (daily rotation):** pick 2-3 (DMs, Twitter, system health)
- **Tier 3 (weekly):** MEMORY.md review, archive old files
- **Night (11pm-8am UTC):** skip checks, emergencies only

### 2. Dual-Layer Memory
```
memory/
├── MEMORY.md      # Long-term prefs, identity
└── 2026-02-19.md  # Daily logs, temp tasks
```

### 3. Handoff Packets (7 fields)
1. Goal (one sentence)
2. Current state
3. Next action
4. Constraints
5. Known unknowns
6. Artifacts/links
7. Stop conditions

### 4. Two-Agent Dev
- **Architect** — decides what to build, writes spec
- **Coder** — implements, runs tests, commits
- Different models for different tasks

### 5. Context Engineering > Model Scale
Best retrieval + memory beats bigger models.

## Useful Tools
- **Ranger** — Automated browser QA (docs.ranger.net)
- **Pull That Up Jamie** — Podcast research (pullthatupjamie.ai)
- **xfor.bot** — X/Twitter integration
- **DKG Swarm** — Verifiable on-chain memory

## Recent Activity (Feb 2026)

### Trading Strategy Evolution
- Combined SMC + Sniper strategy created from Institutional Price Action cheat sheet
- Deprecated momentum-only strategy in favor of combined approach
- Focus on: HTF structure, QM patterns, 2+ confluences, R:R ≥ 1:2

### Current Positions (Feb 22)
- BCH, TRX, M - Open using combined strategy
- Risk: 1.5% per trade, 4.5% total
- All stops at 5%

## Health Metrics to Track
- Readiness score (task success rate)
- Error rate
- Token usage over time
- Context bloat
